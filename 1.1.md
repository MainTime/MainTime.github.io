<br />
<br />Enhanced Lights and FX has the goal to create a more dramatic and realistic mood to the Skyrim lights by adding lights to all light sources and removing any light without a source, as well as the addition many more effects like smoke, volumic lights, driples, etc. I made some friendly redesigns as needed too, and some redesigns for more dramatic looking.
<br />

<br />Download the mod using Nexus Mod Manager, activate it and pick the modules you want in the installer.
<br />

<br />
<br />[b][u]Enhanced Light and FX[/u][/b]
<br />
<br />Should be compatible with any mod that doesn't change light, fx or the meshes it adds, my meshes are a must have, so make sure it overwrites anything it asks to. You can stick with LOOT load order.
<br />
<br />[b][u]The ELFX Enhancer[/u][/b] 
<br />
<br />-Should be compatible with any mod that doesn't change imagespaces and lighting templates, which means ambient light, fog, contrast, saturation, bloom, depth of field, etc.

<br />
<br />[b][u]The ELFX Weathers[/u][/b]
<br />
<br />-It should be compatible with any mod that doesn't change the weathers. It may be compatible with Climates of Tamriel, because it doesn't change the vanilla weathers, but I don't recommend it, because CoT has so much weathers that you may barely experience mine.
<br />
<br />[b][u]Enhanced Ice[/u][/b]
<br />
<br />-It should be compatible with any ice retexture and any mod that change the icebergs.
<br />
<br />

### Enhanced Textures Detail (UV-Tweaks) 1.1.5

Installed 23.10.2020 from [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/992/) (Visuals and Graphics)

[size=3]<br /><br />[u]THIS IS NOT A RETEXTURE MOD AND IT WILL USE YOUR EXISTING TEXTURES&#33;[/u]<br />more information after the videos<br /><br />Show videos<br />[spoiler]<br />[youtube]Up5RxT26D38[/youtube]<br />[youtube]I6hmYNj5xd8[/youtube]<br /><br />[youtube]2HS9IryqjAQ[/youtube]<br />[youtube]NPsQBNkIPtI[/youtube]<br />[/spoiler]<br /><br />[/size][u][b][size=4]Forewarning:[/size][/b][/u]<br /> <br />[size=3]While greatly enhancing close distance and close-up detail of your textures on many objects, the general look of your texture on these objects will be altered (watch videos to understand exactly what I mean), so if you are not bothered by close distance and close-up detail of textures and you like how your medium-distance and distant objects look then this mod will not be of any help to you, but if you are annoyed by the constant smudged textures you see when you walk too close to objects, then this mod will be very helpful.<br />[/size]<br />[u][b][size=4]Basic information:[/size][/b][/u]<br /><br />[size=3]This mod will increase texture quality for all your existing textures and any other new textures that you will download in the future, for objects that I edited.  Your textures will remain the same, but their pattern will appear smaller (that&#39;s how we get extra close-up detail from them). And if you don&#39;t like the look of your old texture for a particular object with a smaller pattern after installing ETD, you can just install a new texture (as you normally would, no extra work needed) for that object that has a larger image pattern to begin with, so even if the pattern is made smaller by ETD, they&#39;ll still look good for you, but also have an enhanced close-distance detail.<br /><br />While I have edited alot of objects (1085 so far), it does not increase texture detail on absolutely everything yet, to find out which objects I edited so far, read this information in the installer window.<br /><br />This mod doesn&#39;t require you to do anything special for the most part, just download it and install supplied files.<br />This mod does not contain any .esp files and there are no scripts, this mod only provides meshes and textures. This data is not stored in your save games, so it will never corrupt your save game and this also means that this mod can be fully or partially installed/uninstalled freely at any point in your game with 0 problems.  <br /><br />And because we are using the same texture and only really changing the method of how this preloaded texture is applied onto an object mesh, even after increasing the resolution and detail of your texture, [u]your performance will not be affected in any way.[/u]<br /><br />That&#39;s all you need to know to start using it, but you can<br /><br />Read below for [/size]<br /><br />[b][u]More information and some of the known drawbacks of this method:[/u][/b]<br /><br />[spoiler]<br />This mod mostly contains vanilla meshes with changed UV-maps.<br /><br />This mod will enhance texture detail of modified objects (through installation of supplied meshes) by letting the mesh faces use larger area of the loaded texture and allowing the mesh itself to use more samples of the same texture to effectively multiply the resolution. <br /><br />Before this mod, to get a higher clarity image, you&#39;d need to upgrade your texture resolution, which came at the cost of more Vram. And on some objects, even having 4k textures wasn&#39;t making them look as good as you&#39;d expect, this can happen if the face of any particular mesh is using too small an area of the texture relative to it&#39;s size. When we edit the UV-map, we can make mesh faces use a larger area of any texture that&#39;s loaded for it, or by letting the mesh use more samples of the same texture where needed, and all at the cost of 0 extra Vram or GPU utilization. While this mod mostly benefits people who use low resolution textures to save Vram, it will still work even if you use 4k textures, although unless you play on a 4k monitor, it&#39;s positive effects will be somewhat limited to meshes which had terrible UV-maps to begin with.<br /> <br />However, because we are now letting each mesh face use a much large area of the same texture, the repetitive pattern may become obvious when used in conjunction with particular textures that aren&#39;t well suited.<br /> <br />So, keeping all this in mind, there are 3 possible drawbacks (i like to think of them as trade-offs) that you should be prepared to encounter:<br /><br />1)  Because we are now letting each mesh face use a much larger area of the same texture, you may sometimes notice that the texture on a distant object looks repetitive, this happens if the texture you use, uses a very distinctive pattern and when you look at this object from a distance, it becomes obvious that the same texture is being applied more than once. In 70% of the cases, this can be solved by using a different texture that doesn&#39;t have distinct patterns that you can easily tell apart. On my end, to hide repetition, I do use reduced scaling where the objects are in the open space and are often viewed from the distance and I try to move the texture patterns around where seams are not an issue, but to get extra resolution with no performance impact this mod depends on texture repetition, so on certain objects it&#39;s just not possible to do anything about it and this should be expected.<br /><br />2) For outside objects like Forts, the transition from distant object (LOD) to a real model will become much more obvious, as the texture pattern on the real model is much smaller than it was on the LOD model. I personally used DynDoLod to give Fort LODs a smaller texture pattern, but without DynDoLod i&#39;m not sure how to address this yet. Don&#39;t select Forts (exterior) option during installation if this bothers you.<br /><br />3) Depending on the texture you use, you may notice seams at the locations where the textures are being connected.<br />This happens because the texture imagespace only used a single stretched texture, and when we increase the amount of textures for that same imagespace, If the textures are not seamless, a seam may appear at the connection points of these textures. This issue however, is pretty rare.<br />[/spoiler]<br /><br />[u][b][size=3]Installation[/size][/b][/u]<br /><br />[spoiler]  <br />FOMOD installer is now included for an easy installation process. <br />[size=1]Installer contains an all in one installation process which will install all the available meshes and a segmented installation which will let you selectively pick which objects you would like this mod to apply to. Both these installer options have a full SMIM compatibility setting, which will remove any conflicting files from installation process.[/size]<br /><br />To uninstall simply delete the mod and if you were using SMIM or other meshes that you&#39;ve overwritten, install them again.<br /><br />Manual installation:<br /><br />All the folders inside core folder of the archive are named according to what they change, just copy meshes and textures folders and put them inside skyrim sse/data folder<br /><br />All folders inside Vanilla_textures folder are optional, you don&#39;t really need them but you can install them if you want original Bethesda textures instead of the new ones that Bethesda rolled out with SSE.<br />Optional files are located inside the optional folder.<br />[/spoiler]<br /><br />[b][size=3]More detailed information is provided in the first sticky post in the comments section.[/size][/b]<br /><br />--------<br /><br />Credits:<br />Renthal311 for allowing me to use his woven fence meshes as part of my farmhouses enhancements.<br />Langley02 for providing grave textures for Windhelm graveyard.<br />[b]Cabal120 for providing a stonewall texture.<br /><br />Permissions:<br />You are free to use any of my work in your mods, it&#39;d be nice to get credited if you do, but whatever, as long as your work benefits our community i&#39;m happy.<br />[/b]

### Fluffy Snow - 2K 1.4.0

Installed 23.10.2020 from [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8955/) (Models and Textures) 


> By Metalsaber for Skyrim Special Edition (Default)

Fluffy Snow is a texture replacer for the landscape snow.  My aim was to make the snow a little more "fluffy" than vanilla.  This mod contains textures only and should be safe to add/remove mid game.  The textures are 2048x2048, so shouldn't affect performance much.  
<br />
<br />Notes: 4K images include mods such as Dolomite Weathers, Enhanced Lighting and Effects, Re-Engaged ENB. 1080 resolution images use vanilla lighting and weather.  No ENB used on 1080p images.  It gives you an idea of what it could look like on your machine.  Obviously your lighting and enb choices may produce different results.
<br />
<br />Majestic Mountains users. I've updated T4GTR43UM3R's (with his permission) ProjectedDiffuse.dds file. This affects mountain snow as well as other snow textures like boards and house snow.  It now looks closer to Fluffy Snow. Note that Majestic Mountains is required for this to work.  Again this is optional and not required if you are not using 
<br />
<br />Thanks to all of you who downloaded and endorsed this mod.  If you like this mod and haven't endorsed it, please consider.  Thanks!!!

### Footprints 1.5.3 1.5.3

Installed 23.10.2020 from [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3808/) (Visuals and Graphics) 


> By jonwd7 for Skyrim Special Edition (Default)

[img]https://i.imgur.com/nO9A4Ix.png[/img]<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/MqcxHqv.png[/img]<br />[right][/right]<br />v1.5.3 - 11/21/2016<br /><br />Adds footprints to the player, NPCs, and creatures. <br /><br /><br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/xxWZMve.png[/img][color=#313131][size=4][u][b]Currently Implemented[/b][/u][/size][/color]<br /><br />    [size=4]&bull;[/size]  All humanoid (non-creature) NPCs<br />    [size=4]&bull;[/size]   Bear, Deer, Draugr, Falmer, Foxes, Frost Atronachs, Hagravens, Horses, Sabrecats, Skeletons, Wolves, Giants, Mammoths, Spriggans, Cows, Goats, Trolls, Skeevers, and Werewolves.<br />    [size=4]&bull;[/size]   DLC Races:  Death Hounds, Vampire Lord, Werebears, Benthic Lurkers, plus the reskins of vanilla races.<br />    [size=4]&bull;[/size]  Particle FX<br />    [size=4]&bull;[/size]   Race-switching support for player character. Shape Shifter mods should work fine given I have the prints implemented for the race in question.<br />    [size=4]&bull;[/size]  Ash prints and FX (Dragonborn)<br />    [size=4]&bull;[/size]  Customizable limits for number of NPCs with footprints and number of NPCs with footprint FX.<br />    [size=4]&bull;[/size]  Custom Footprints hook for modders who want to add footprints for their races.<br /><br />[size=4]New in 1.5.3<br />[/size]<br />    [size=4]&bull;[/size] Fixed the Giant&#39;s footprints not showing up.<br />    [size=4]&bull;[/size] Numerous script improvements and some minor fixes. See Changelog/Readme for more details.<br /><br />[size=4]New in 1.5.2<br />[/size]<br />    [size=4]&bull;[/size] Resaved normal maps in linear BC7. When rushing to convert them for 1.5.1, I inadvertently saved most of them as sRGB BC7 which caused slightly incorrect lighting. <br /><br />[size=4]New in 1.5.1[/size]<br /><br />    [size=4]&bull;[/size] Replaced old texture formats that were causing crashes for some people with new DX11 formats. Specifically, some of the _n files.<br />    [size=4]&bull;[/size] Converted the _h DDS files to a better DX11 format.<br /><br />[size=4]New in 1.5<br />[/size]<br />1. Ported to SSE<br /><br />2. Added several optimizations<br />   [size=4]&bull;[/size]  The system that adds footprint effects to NPCs will no longer run in any interiors whatsoever, which unfortunately disables the effect in some ice caves and a few other interiors which have snow.  The PC will continue to have prints in these locations however.<br />   [size=4]&bull;[/size]  The system will turn off for entire world spaces and locations where the effects for any supported material (snow, ash, etc) are not necessary.  This includes places like Riften, Markarth, Solitude, Whiterun and their surrounding exteriors.  I will continue to add locations deemed suitable in future updates.<br />   [size=4]&bull;[/size]  Footprints on NPCs will now expire after a short duration and they need to be close enough to regain the effect. <br /><br />3. The optimization options from the MCM in 1.0 still remain even though the MCM was removed for SSE.  You can configure the limits for NPCs and FX via the console, as well as turn off the system entirely (see below).<br /><br /><br />[color=#FFFFFF][size=4]New in 1.0[/size][/color]<br /><br />1. Major rewrite.<br />   [size=4]&bull;[/size]   In order to *vastly* simplify the scripts, Dawnguard and Dragonborn DLC are now required.<br />   [size=4]&bull;[/size]   Scripts are now templated (e.g. Biped, Quadruped, Werecreature) so there are now fewer total unique scripts in use.<br />   [size=4]&bull;[/size]   NPC Footprints and NPC Footprints with FX are now &#34;ref counted&#34;, i.e. tracked.<br />       This is done so that they can be limited by the user.  If you want no NPCs to have prints at all, you set this to 0. You can also set the number of FX prints to 0 to disable particle FX.  This does not apply to the player and some races like horses.<br /><br />2. Extensibility with a Custom Footprints hook<br />   [size=4]&bull;[/size]   Third party plugins can add additional footprints to the game. This can be used for custom races or to override existing ones.<br />   [size=4]&bull;[/size]   Script templates for Bipeds, Quadrupeds, and more allow mod authors to include footprints for their races without any scripts of their own.<br />   [size=4]&bull;[/size]   Separate FormLists for extending the Player footprints and the NPC footprints. Meaning a third party plugin can target only the Player or only the NPCs if needed.<br />   [size=4]&bull;[/size]   To use more than one plugin, the end user will need to be able to merge the FormLists from each plugin with a merged patch.<br /><br /><br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/D9PGSKN.png[/img][color=#313131][u][b][size=4]FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)<br />[/size][/b][/u][/color]<br />    [size=4][font=arial, helvetica, sans-serif][b]Q[/b][/font][/size]  [size=4][b]This isn&#39;t working for me.[/b][/size]<br />    [size=4][font=arial, helvetica, sans-serif][b]A[/b][/font][/size]  The two most common issues in this case are:<br />   &bull;  You don&#39;t have decals turned on.<br />   &bull;  You are improperly using the console to COC from the main menu or from the intro cutscene in a new game. This is not a proper way to test ANY mod.<br /> <br />    [size=4][font=arial, helvetica, sans-serif][b]Q[/b][/font][/size]  [size=4][b]Is there a performance/FPS hit?[/b][/size]<br />    [size=4][font=arial, helvetica, sans-serif][b]A[/b][/font][/size]  It will likely depend on your system and how many mods you have already installed.<br />    [color=#313131][size=4][font=arial, helvetica, sans-serif][b]A[/b][/font][/size][/color]  I see no performance impact whatsoever. See: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/articles/291/]Article[/url], [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUzRwEYolrU]Video[/url]<br /><br />    [size=4][font=arial, helvetica, sans-serif][b]Q[/b][/font][/size]  [size=4][b]Is it compatible with ________ mod?[/b][/size]<br />    [size=4][font=arial, helvetica, sans-serif][b]A[/b][/font][/size]  It is self contained and doesn&#39;t touch vanilla races or NPCs, so it is inherently compatible with all mods. However, it does rely on certain things like bone names, their positions in the skeleton, and the correct animation events being sent by the animations.  There are mods which break these things.  If you suspect any incompatibilities, look at your animation replacers before anything else.<br /><br />    [size=4][font=arial, helvetica, sans-serif][b]Q[/b][/font][/size]  [size=4][b]Do you support custom playable races?[/b][/size]<br />    [size=4][font=arial, helvetica, sans-serif][b]A[/b][/font][/size]  My mod will attach footprints to ANY humanoid races as long as they use the humanoid skeleton and the mod properly defines the race as &#34;ActorTypeNPC&#34;.<br /><br />    [size=4][font=arial, helvetica, sans-serif][b]Q[/b][/font][/size]  [size=4][b]Will you support ___________ monster mod?[/b][/size]<br />    [size=4][font=arial, helvetica, sans-serif][b]A[/b][/font][/size]  Other modders can create plugins which provide additional footprints to the game with the Custom Footprints hook. Details and resources will eventually be provided for this process, including some example ESPs.<br /><br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/MqcxHqv.png[/img]<br /><br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/bUCILjN.png[/img]<br /><br />[center][youtube]4EiwzdLPrQM[/youtube][/center]<br /><br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/MqcxHqv.png[/img]<br /><br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/rhUyARq.png[/img][color=#313131][size=4][u][b]Technical Stuff (Install/Upgrade/Uninstall)[/b][/u][/size][/color]<br /><br />[size=4][u][b]INSTALLATION[/b][/u][/size]<br />Install the BSA and ESP to your Data folder. Activate the ESP.<br /><br />[size=4][u][b]UNINSTALLATION[/b][/u][/size]<br />** It is highly recommended you simply disable the effect via the console and not attempt removal **<br /><br />[b]Instructions<br />[/b]<br />1. Open the console and enter:<br /><br />    set fp_IsFootprintsDisabled to 1<br /><br />It will eventually shut off completely.<br />**IT IS NOW AS GOOD AS DISABLED**<br />It will periodically check if fp_IsFootprintsDisabled is set to 0 and otherwise there is ZERO overhead.<br />**THERE IS NO BENEFIT IN ATTEMPTING A FULL UNINSTALL**<br /><br />If you absolutely must attempt to uninstall it, do the following: <br /><br />1. Play for a while (real-life hours, days) then go to an INTERIOR.<br />**There seems to be some general confusion about this 1st point**<br />**You cannot have footprints anywhere on the ground before disabling**<br />**If you save in an Interior, when traveling outside the game SHOULD remove any decals if their ESP has been disabled but this is not a guarantee**<br />2. Save the game and Exit.<br />3. Disable/Remove the ESP.<br />4. Load the game and make a new save.<br />**AT THIS POINT YOU CANNOT USE ANY OLD SAVES THAT ARE SAVED IN AN EXTERIOR WHICH HAS FOOTPRINTS**<br />**IF YOU ATTEMPT TO LOAD A SAVE IN AN EXTERIOR WITH FOOTPRINTS YOU WILL CTD**<br />**IF YOU NEED TO ACCESS THESE SAVES, SIMPLY RE-ENABLE THE ESP**<br />**THIS IS WHY IT IS RECOMMENDED TO LEAVE THE ESP ACTIVE BUT WITH ALL SCRIPTING DISABLED**<br /><br />IF/WHEN Hadoram&#39;s is redone for SSE:<br />5. OPTIONAL: Clean the save using Hadoram&#39;s Save Cleaner. You can look these instructions up yourself.<br /><br />[u][b][size=4]RE-ENABLING<br />[/size][/b][/u]** For if you have disabled Footprints via console and would like to re-enable it **<br /><br />[b]Instructions<br />[/b]<br />1. Open the console and enter:<br /><br />    set fp_IsFootprintsDisabled to 0<br /><br />It will eventually turn back on.<br /><br />[size=4][u][b]COMMAND LINE<br /><br />[/b][/u][/size]To modify the NPC limit (default 50):<br /><br />    set fp_FootprintsNPCLimit to X<br /><br />To modify the FX limit (default 20):<br /><br />    set fp_FootprintsFXLimit to X<br /><br />where X is your desired value.<br /><br />[size=4][u][b]COMPATIBILITY[/b][/u][/size]<br /><br />- Certain animation replacers can break the animation events being sent, and if you use these your player will not receive footprints.  There is nothing on my end that I can do.  This mod works on the vanilla animations and skeletons, so the fix has to be on their end.<br />- I have confirmed that FNIS/XPMSSE by themselves are compatible with Footprints, but the animations you are using may not be (see above point).<br /><br /><br />[size=4][u][b]PERMISSIONS / LICENSING[/b][/u][/size]<br />Permission is NOT given to redistribute this mod in whole or in part.<br /><br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/MqcxHqv.png[/img]<br /><br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/NA2uGEt.png[/img][color=#313131][size=4][u][b]Special Thanks[/b][/u][/size][/color]<br />Chesko for initial brainstorming<br />RalphDamiani for initial test textures<br />eztwister for the mod idea<br /><br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/WKeIJcF.png[/img]

### HD Photorealistic Ivy 1.1.0

Installed 23.10.2020 from [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10305/) (Models and Textures) 


> By greenback12 for Skyrim Special Edition (Default)

This is a project i did for myself to learn creating textures from the scratch. The base source is from real ivy photos and the texture was made for [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/84381?]Oldrim[/url] and now I ported it to SSE. I like the result and maybe you want to use it, too. The Texture is in 2048 x 2048 resolution and normal maps are uncompressed. I had to tweak the UV maps, so the mod has its own meshes (optimized for SSE). <br /><br />Many Thanks to [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/31442620/?tb=mods&pUp=1]Ray84[/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/18469894/?]Hape66[/url] for the awesome screenshots (made with Rudy ENB).<br /><br />[b]Installation/Deinstallation[/b]<br />Just install it with a manager/organizer of your choice and overwrite the files. If you do the installation manually, than i think you know what you have to do (make backups). When uninstalling you have to watch out, that you don´t forget to delete the meshes, too.<br /><br />[b]Combatibility[/b]<br />This mod does not work with all standalone ivy mods, that changes the file &#34;textures/architecture/farmhouse/ivy01&#34;. In case of overhauls you have to watch, if the overhaul contains this file. If not, all is cool. if it does, than you have to make a choice. <br /><br />It won´t work perfectly with other meshes, cause the uv maps are different. <br />Mod´s like [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9768/?]R´s Farmhouse and Handcarts [/url]need a little tweak. [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/31442620/?tb=mods&pUp=1]Ray84[/url] give me permission, so you can download compatible meshes in the update download section. [b]After you installed R´s Farmhouse, you have to install the ivy mod first and then let the update file overwrite the meshes. <br /><br />[/b]There is also a comatible patch for [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/992/?tab=2&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrimspecialedition%2Fajax%2Fmodfiles%2F%3Fid%3D992&pUp=1]Enhanced Textures Detail (UV-tweaks)[/url] in the update section. <br /><br />You can report me, if other mod-meshes need an update, i will have take a look. <br /><br />[youtube]OQ5ks-NFYJA[/youtube]<br /> Thanks to [url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWK940VPOyd0P32FgPdz2Jg]Ultimate Immersion[/url] for this awesome video&#33;<br /><br /><br />[youtube]k0InyUsLokY[/youtube]<br />Thanks to [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/games/users/30658615/?]DonProtein[/url] to show the ivy (at 5:09). Please support his [url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHEdKzHeo5OiJhhiGG95wkA]channel[/url] and also look at the other great mods in this video.<br /><br /><br /><br />[img width=755,height=424]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/10305-3-1496952819.png[/img]<br /><br /><br />[b]<br />Credits[/b]<br />The photos i used to creating the ivy texture are from [url=https://pixabay.com/]http://pixabay.com<br />[/url]The Meshes for R&#39;s and Handcarts are original made from the great [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/5851384/?tb=mods&pUp=1]renthall311 [/url]for Oldrim and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/31442620/?tb=mods&pUp=1]Ray84[/url] ported them with permission to the SSE.<br />The Meshes for Enhanced Textures Detail are made by [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/33206951/?]somerandomguy83<br />[/url][/center][center][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9810/?]Here my other Ivy-Mod[/url][/center]

<br />[size=2]The reason i ask people to overwrite the above mods it's because i keep the best qualities of each mod and combine them with mien aka "best of both worlds" Example: I improved the wall baskets shape and smim improves the hanging feathers of them, so i kept my mesh with the new uvs and transfered smim's new feathers to mien. All of the "conflicting" meshes are like that, keeping the shader properties of ELFX while keeping my mesh. I just wanted to clear that up cause i saw some misunderstandings regarding the reasons i ask people to overwrite them and it certainly isn't because i think my meshes are "superior".[/size]

<br />[color=#cfe2f3][size=4][b]- FAQ -[/b][/size][/color][size=3]
<br />
<br />- [color=#e06666]What is the performance hit?
<br />[/color]Minimal&#92;None reported yet, decent cpu is more important here.
<br />
<br />- [color=#e06666]Your meshes are terrible![/color]
<br />They are better than vanilla and that's all i wanted.
<br />
<br />- [color=#e06666]Why is the polygon count so high?[/color]
<br />Because the engine can take it, and it's also the easiest way to make the objects smooth and or realistic.
<br />
<br />[/size][size=3]- [/size][size=3][color=#e06666]Oldrim updated version please?[/color]
<br />I don't mod things i don't play, join us in SSE.
<br />
<br />-[color=#e06666] Can i give you suggestions?[/color]
<br />Always! Suggestions and constructive feedback is always welcome and needed.

<br />[center][color=#9fc5e8][size=6]DESCRIPTION[/size][/color]
<br />
<br />Just Ice is a re-texture mod for ice textures which are used on objects such as glaciers, icebergs, ice sheets and ice floes. Three resolution options are provided for maximum choice and performance if required. This mod prides itself on having no upscaling to meet true 4k resolution, no noise overlays to make it seem more detailed, and being handmade from scratch specifically for SSE. These textures WILL NOT work with the regular version of Skyrim as they are saved in a DX11+ required format for maximum quality. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Best with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9121/?]Better Dynamic Snow[/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/670/?]Nordic Snow[/url].[/center][line]
<br />[center][color=#9fc5e8][size=6]COMPATIBILITY[/size][/color][/center]

<br />NATFX are optional and fps lossless visual settings to change the graphics of the game like a built-in Enb.
<br />
<br />In the current released version of NAT only few presets are implemented,
<br />but I plan to work on this part of the mod later and if possible, to reproduce the NACFX system from Fallout 4.

<br />[b]  ♦ Graphic Options[/b] let you chose what NAT's feature to use and are explained below ([i]see NAT Graphics[/i])
<br />
<br />[b]  ♦ Random Weather [/b]instantly loads a random weather. The name of the weather appears in the upper left corner of the screen, followed with the area of the game where it belongs. [color=#d8d8d8]If no region is shown then the weather is common to all regions.[/color] 
<br />Some weathers can belong to different regions but if they don't, any random weather will start to change to a regional weather as soon as it is called. 
<br />
<br />[b]  ♦ Night Settings[/b] offers the possibility to darken or brighten the nights. Can be useful when playing in a bright room or to please anyone tastes.
<br />
<br />[b]  ♦ Climate Settings[/b] give the opportunity to change the atmosphere of the game by changing in game the chances of each weather to spawn and by disabling some ([i]see NAT Climate below[/i]) [/spoiler]

<br />The default climate is [b]Natural &amp; Atmospheric[/b], using all weathers available with balanced atmosphere.
<br />
<br />[b]Bright &amp; Pleasant[/b] disables some of the darkest weathers and reduces the chances of the much cloudiest one to give a very sunny, cheerful and summery atmosphere with a very low chance of rain.
<br />[b]Dark &amp; Gloomy [/b]on the contrary, disables the most sunny weathers and reduces the chances of the bright days to offer a cold, dark and grit atmosphere.

<br />NAT doesn't only change and add new weathers but it also changes and enhances a lot of light sources, particles and special effects, clouds and sun effects, snow shader and color, tweaks dynamically many ini settings depending of various situations for both interior and exterior locations and reworks entirely the tonemapping of the game.
<br />
<br />The NAT particle overhaul will mostly benefit to Enb makers and can be compared with what Oldrim's [i]Particle Patch for Enbs[/i] achieves.
<br />
<br />NAT also fakes cloud shadowing for cloudy weathers, wetness for foggy and rainy situations, sub surface scattering, additional skylighting, 
<br />diffuse lighting for dawn and dusk time...
<br />The [i]Graphic Options[/i] from the NAT Settings can be used to toggle some of this features:

<br />Still, it remains [b]compatible with interior and lighting mods[/b] such as ELFX, RLO or ELE or torch mods like Torch Shadows.
<br />It only requires you [b]to choose which one has the priority over the other[/b]: NAT only changes some light sources and all lighting templates.
<br />Example:
<br />- If you want to keep NAT interior settings combined with ELFX then load [b]NAT [u]after[/u] ELFX[/b]. 
<br />- if you only want to keep ELFX and no light edits from NAT then load [b]NAT [u]before[/u] ELFX[/b].
<br />Same for torch mods.[/spoiler]

<br />[line]
<br />[line]
<br />
<br />[b][size=6]Overview[/size][/b]
<br />
<br />One of the many upgrades to Skyrim Special Edition is the new water flow system that allows water to bend around turns and change speed depending on the environment. While the water is much improved over the original edition of Skyrim, flowing water was applied to nearly all bodies of water, indiscriminately, resulting in odd looking water in certain situations, such as small marsh pools that flow like rivers. Realistic Water Two's (RWT) goal is to correct these issues; thus, providing realistic bodies of water. Lake, marsh, pond, river, and many more waters are provided to create visually distinct bodies of water.
<br />
<br />
<br />[b][size=4]Features [/size][/b]
<br />[list]
<br />[*][size=2]Lakes and ocean water share the same water, visually. This fixes most distant LOD issues.[/size]
<br />[*][size=2]Lakes, ponds, marsh, and small bodies of water no longer flow in any particular direction.[/size]
<br />[*][size=2]Ponds, marsh, volcanic, and other waters have unique colors.[/size]
<br />[*][size=2]Lakes, rivers, and oceans have new, ambient sound effects. Ponds are silent.[/size]
<br />[*][size=2]Animated water for blacksmith troughs.[/size]
<br />[*][size=2]Icebergs and ice chunks will sometimes crack and gurgle.[/size]
<br />[*][size=2]Waves from the Dragonborn DLC have been added to the coastline of Skyrim.[/size]
<br />[*][size=2]MCM to support RWT features and to expand those features to other mods.[/size]
<br />[*][size=2]Fixes terrible landscape along the shore across from Solitude docks.[/size]
<br />[/list]
<br />[b]Assets[/b]
<br />[list]
<br />[*][size=2]Large waterfalls now have improved textures, smoothed 3D geometry, faster animation, added particle splashes, expanded steam cloud particles, color edits, and increased effect distances.[/size]
<br />[*][size=2]Waves were slowed down, retextured, and now have a crashing water sound effect. The splash/foam effects were made more visible.[/size]
<br />[*][size=2]Foam effects have been retextured and were generated from a high resolution 3D water simulation.[/size]
<br />[*][size=2]Splash effects have been retextured and captured directly from high quality 3D particles.[/size]
<br />[*][size=2]Fog and steam cloud textures have been retextured.[/size]
<br />[*][size=2]Rapids have been changed to remove ugly lines and seams. Particle splashes have also been added to rapids near rocks.[/size]
<br />[*][size=2]Churning water and fountains have been edited to reduce visible seams. They have also been retextured.[/size]
<br />[*][size=2]Character splashes have been retextured and reworked. Their 3D model has also been tweaked to provide further realism. [/size]
<br />[*][size=2]Rain ripples will no longer slide across the surface of the water. They've also been retextured and transparency has been increased.[/size]
<br />[*][size=2]The green reflections emitted by some meshes when viewed at a certain angle is a bug that was introduced with Skyrim Special Edition. This bug is now fixed.[/size]
<br />[*][size=2]New meshes for volcanic water vents that have a heat wave effect.[/size]
<br />[*][size=2]New sound files for water, waterfalls, waves, and ice.[/size]
<br />[/list]
<br />
<br />[b][size=4]Optional Options[/size][/b] (available in the main archive)
<br />[list]
<br />[*][size=2][b]Waves:[/b] New hand-placed waves added along the coast of Skyrim at locations that make sense. Additional waves have also been added to Solstheim. MCM only.[/size]
<br />[*][size=2][b]Extended Ambiance:[/b] Extends the lake and ocean ambient looping sound effects from 30 seconds to 50 seconds.[/size]
<br />[*][size=2][b]Half Res Textures:[/b] These optional textures are provided for users playing on low settings. Textures are 1K; half the size of vanilla.[/size]
<br />[*][size=2][b]Smaller Water Drops:[/b] These optional textures will produce a smaller water droplet for water drip effects. This is provided for users you feel the droplets are too large in vanilla, however, this could make them difficult to see.[/size]
<br />[/list]
<br />
<br />[b][size=4]Version Scheme[/size][/b]
<br />Since I (TechAngel85) started managing several mods for various authors, I adopted a standardized managing style to keep myself organized while doing so. One of the changes I typically make is to regulate the version scheme with something that is structured and makes sense. The new scheme will be as follows:
<br />
<br />[b][color=#93c47d]Major[/color].[color=#ffd966]Minor[/color].[color=#e06666]Hotfix[/color][/b]
<br />[list]
<br />[*][color=#93c47d]Major[/color] = major changes to assets which alter the look and feel of the mod, new scripts (if applicable), new meshes or textures, etc.
<br />[*][color=#ffd966]Minor[/color] = compatibility updates, new patches, larger bug fix roll-outs, existing mesh or texture edits, etc. 
<br />[*][color=#e06666]Hotfix[/color] = hot-fixes, single bug fixes, update to installer code, etc. 
<br />[/list]
<br />

<br />
<br />[b][size=6]Installation / Updating / Uninstall[/size][/b]
<br />
<br />
<br />To install, simply download the file using your respective manager and use the provided FOMOD installer.
<br />[list]
<br />[*] File structure supports BAIN.
<br />[*]Manual installation is [i]not[/i] supported. [i]Use a mod manager![/i] 
<br />[*]Supported mod managers include: MO2, Vortex, and WB
<br />[/list]
<br />
<br />[b][size=4]ENB Users:[/size][/b]
<br />The core textures are designed to work out-of-the-box with ENBSeries water effects. Ensure your [i]enbseries.ini[/i] file reflects the following:
<br />
<br />[b][EFFECT][/b]
<br />[color=#ffd966]EnableWater[/color]=[color=#93c47d]true[/color]
<br />
<br />[b][WATER][/b]
<br />[color=#ffd966]DisableDistantReflection[/color]=[color=#93c47d]true[/color]
<br />[color=#ffd966]EnableCaustics[/color]=[color=#93c47d]true[/color] (optional but adds a nice effect)
<br />[color=#ffd966]EnableParallax[/color]=[color=#93c47d]true[/color]
<br />[color=#ffd966]EnableDisplacement[/color]=[color=#93c47d]true[/color]
<br />
<br />The remainder of the [b][WATER][/b] settings are user preference; adjust them to your preference. The following are a few tips for ENB users:
<br />[list]
<br />[*]If the water is too clear, turn up the [b]Muddiness[/b] setting.
<br />[*]Underwater caustics effect requires [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23174]ENB Helper SE[/url].
<br />[*]If experiencing water clipping through other planes of water that have been placed on top, please report the location of the issue. Turn off Tessellation to fix this until the issue is fixed on our end.
<br />[/list]
<br />
<br />[b][size=4]Updating:[/size][/b]
<br />Create a save indoors before updating to newer versions. MO users should choose to "Replace" the mod. Wrye Bash users may need to Anneal some mods.
<br />
<br />
<br />[b][size=4]Uninstall:[/size][/b]
<br />Use your mod manager to remove the mod. It is not recommended to uninstall mods mid-game.

<br />[b][size=4]Not Compatible[/size][/b]
<br />The following mods are not compatible with Realistic Water Two:
<br />
<br />[b]SSEEdit Script - Fix Oldrim Mods Waterflow[/b] - ([url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5221?]link[/url]﻿)
<br />This mod checks for the existence of "RiverWaterFlow" on cell records. RWT intentionally changes some of these records to provide the various custom waters. This script [i]cannot[/i] be run on any plugins provided by Realistic Water Two; doing so will break intended edits.
<br />
<br />[line]
<br />[line]
<br />
<br />[b][size=6]Recommendations[/size][/b]
<br />
<br />[b]INI Edits[/b]
<br />Turn off Sky reflection in your INI. Sky reflections will cause the LOD seam to be more visible on the water's surface. [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4875]BethINI[/url] is highly recommended!
<br />
<br />[b]Majestic Mountains[/b] - ([url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11052/]link[/url])
<br />Install Majestic Mountains [b][i]before[/i][/b]  RWT.
<br />Majestic Mountains includes three meshes that conflict with RWT. Users should overwrite Majestic Mountains with RWT, for the time being. They are two creek meshes and one river rapids mesh.
<br />
<br />[b]SMIM[/b] - ([url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/659/]link[/url])
<br />Install SMIM [b][i]before[/i][/b]  RWT.
<br />SMIM has one mesh that conflicts with RWT. Users should allow RWT to overwrite this mesh when using both mods or delete/hide the file from the SMIM installation. RWT fixes a green glow on this mesh caused by certain lighting conditions. The SMIM mesh was used as the base for the included, fixed file so users are still getting the SMIM fixes/updates.
<br />
<br />[b]ENB Particle Patch[/b] - ([url=http://enbseries.enbdev.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1499]link[/url]) 
<br />Install ENB Particle Patch [b][i] before[/i] [/b] RWT.
<br />RWT needs to overwrite a lot of effect files in ENB PP. If you don't overwrite ENB PP, you will be missing a lot of visual upgrades and features in RWT. The ENB PP fixes for glowing assets are also contained within RWT's assets, so you will be getting the best of both worlds by overwriting ENB PP with RWT. 
<br />
<br />It has also been noted (thanks noxueaglemail) that the included ENB PP texture [i]gradwhitewater.dds[/i] can cause black spray on rapids. Please hide or remove this texture, as RWT will not overwrite it.
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />[b][size=5]Watercolors[/size][/b]
<br />The following mods provide alternative water colors for RWT. We provide no guarantee they are updated for the current versions of RWT. Nor will we provide support for them. Seek support on their mod pages.

<br />An essential mod for everyone.
<br />
<br />[b]SSE Engine Fixes (skse64 plugin)[/b] - ([url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17230]link[/url])
<br />This mod will fix several issues within the game engine, including some FPS issues with tree LOD, but it's recommended here because it also includes a fix for the new water flow system being tied to the game's timescale. Without this mod, lowering the timescale will slow down the movement of river water. This mod fixes this so that the water flow speed will remain consistent across all timescale settings.

<br />[b][size=6]Bug Reports[/size][/b]
<br />
<br />
<br />[b]A quick statistic: [i]90%[/i] of reports are user error![/b]
<br />
<br />Before reporting any bugs please ensure the issue has been narrowed down to Realistic Water Two and is not a conflict between mods. To do this:
<br />[list=1]
<br />[*][size=2]Remove all the mods except the game's content, the unofficial patches, and Realistic Water Two.[/size]
<br />[*][size=2]Ensure Realistic Water Two plugins are loaded and the ESP is the last mod. If you have other plugins from RWT, follow the load order above.[/size]
<br />[*][size=2]Run the game.[/size]
<br />[*][size=2]At the menu screen, open the console (~)[/size]
<br />[*][size=2]type in: [i]coc riverwood[/i][/size]
<br />[*][size=2]Once in game, open the console again and type in: [i]tmm 1[/i][/size]
<br />[*][size=2]Open your map and travel to the location where the issue was presenting itself. If combat is an issue, you can turn it off with the console command: [i]tcai[/i][/size]
<br />
<br />[/list]
<br />If the issue is no longer present, it is either your mod list or your save file that is the issue. If the issue is still there, you've likely found an issue with the mod. Please report the issue using the "BUGS" tab above. If you're able to narrow the issue down between RWT and another mod, please report it so that I can look into making a patch.
<br />
<br />Else, if you're not sure whether or not it's a RWT issue, you should simply post in the POSTS section. If it's a bug, we can move it to the bug reports later.
<br />
<br />Due to the statistic above, users who don't follow these procedures to narrow down the issue before posting a bug report, will simply have their bug reported deleted. These users didn't take the time to follow these procedures and wasted our time by having to do it for them. We don't have time to sort through bug reports that end up being user error. We will help any users who have diligently attempted to narrow down the issue to RWT.
<br />
<br />[b][size=5]Frequently Asked Questions[/size][/b]
<br />We have put together a [b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/626]FAQ[/url][/b] for users. This should be the first thing users check when investigating issues. Read it before posting a bug report or posting about issues!

<br />If you downloaded the manual version, you need to unzip and extract the archive into your Skyrim/Data directory.
<br />
<br />If you manually install this mod over [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/659/?]SMIM[/url] you will be prompted to overwrite some files.
<br />
<br />If you are using [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2424/?]ELFX[/url], you will have to overwrite some meshes (catacomb small ways and candlehorn chandeliers). You can do this safely. I tested my meshes in game with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2424/?]ELFX[/url] activated and there was no light flickering or other issues.
<br />
<br />Since many things have changed compared to version 2.9. I would strongly recommend to do a clean install with the latest version to prevent problems.

<br />Skyrim is the greatest open-world RPG ever created and includes fantastic 3D character and creature models. However, playing the game for even one hour made me notice Skyrim also contains many ugly 3D models. More precisely, there are quite a few low-polygon static meshes that comprise the architectural elements, clutter, furniture, and landscape objects.
<br />
<br />It would appear that while the artists devoted a large amount of time to create the races, creatures, armors, weapons, and major buildings, the more "boring" 3D models that make up the game world were severely neglected.
<br />
<br />Hence, this mod edits many 3D models to improve their appearance and to fix many of the ugly seams and other oddities. I started in February 2012 with the ultimate goal of improving about 500 of the worst offenders. In June 2014 750+ meshes have been completed; my goal has been exceeded with over 15,000 placements of said meshes! In October 2016 900+ meshes are improved, with over 30,000+ placements! Cool.
<br />
<br />Still, SMIM still has more to do! Improving meshes takes a long time, and I'll release incremental updates to include new 3D models as I finish them.

<br />The [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/modmanager/?]Nexus Mod Manager (NMM)[/url] is recommended for proper installation. If you use NMM, just click the "Download with Manager" button and install!
<br />
<br />The [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266/?]Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch (USSEP)[/url] is HIGHLY recommended. Install order doesn't matter since USSEP is a BSA package meaning SMIM's loose files will always take precedence.
<br />
<br />
<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/Ev5bYMk.png[/img][/center]
<br />SMIM uses many SMIM-specific new textures that are included in the "textures-smim" folder to separate them from vanilla textures. These SMIM-textures always override any other texture replacers you are using. What this means is most of the meshes I edit will use MY textures, not those of other texture replacers you have installed. This isn't a big deal since my SMIM textures are designed to match well with the base game and other high-res texture packs. Just be aware that when using SMIM, you will have to use my textures for most SMIM'd meshes.
<br />
<br />Also, SMIM includes several edited vanilla textures (I fixed errors with them), which do conflict with texture replacers. You just have to decide if you want my fixed vanilla textures or your favorite texture replacer's versions. For example, if you install Skyrim HD first then SMIM, you'll get SMIM's fixed vanilla wood post texture. If you install SMIM first then Skyrim HD, you'll get Skyrim HD's wood post texture. None of this hurts your game. Just remember to generally install SMIM first and then texture replacers.

<br />[list] [*][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/55518/?]Real Roads[/url] - A fantastic mod that makes all the cobblestone roads actually 3D. A truly fantastic visual improvement!

<br />[*] [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1192/]High Quality Food and Ingredients[/url] - A nice collection of food and ingredient textures. Many of these SMIM already improves (won't conflict and SMIM will take priority), but this mod has great powder and moon sugar textures. Some textures are different than vanilla and a matter of preference. 
<br />[*] [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/40564/]SkyFalls and SkyMills[/url] - Adds distant animated waterfalls and windmills. Fantastic! Install before SMIM and let SMIM overwrite the windmill files.

<br />[color=#62fffd][b]What is the performance hit?[/b][/color]
<br />For me, it is zero. In 2013 I was running a 3.3GHz i2500k Intel CPU with a nVidia GeForce 680 with no performance hit. Users with slower machines may take a hit. I have no interest in making low-polygon models. Every model I've included is more detailed than vanilla. A few of my meshes are a LOT more detailed, some even overkill perhaps. Maybe I'll go back and reduce polygons at some point. For now, try my mod, note where your FPS drops (if anywhere) and manually delete certain of my meshes if you desire.
<br />
<br />[color=#62fffd][b]What textures do your models use?[/b][/color][b]
<br />[/b]I use the default vanilla textures whenever possible so that texture replacers will work fine with my mod. However, some models require me to make custom textures to fit my new awesome 3D models. In this case I use my judgment to decide which texture source is best: vanilla, Skyrim HD, or a new custom-made texture by me. What this means is you can't simply use a texture replacer to replace textures for my objects. But all my non-vanilla textures are quite high-resolution. See the texture replacer section above for more information.
<br />
<br />[color=#62fffd][b]I don't like one of your 3D models or textures. How do I solve my issues?[/b][/color]
<br />Well, if you don't like a certain 3D model I've included, you can delete it manually either before or after installation. You'll have to find it yourself and remove it. If you don't like my textures I'm afraid you're stuck with them since other texture replacers won't work for most of my 3D models. If you ask nicely I could perhaps make an alternate texture more to your liking.
<br />
<br />[color=#62fffd][b]Will you improve/fix a certain 3D model?[/b][/color]
<br />Maybe, post in the comments and tell me what you want fixed and why. But don't post spoilers!
<br />
<br />[color=#62fffd][b]Why don't you just enjoy the game as it was made?[/b][/color]
<br />Because I'm OCD. I notice seams, low-polygon models, and other offenses to good artistic design. It's my burden really. I wish I was ignorant of all this, but alas, I know too much...

### Skyrim 3D Rocks 1.0.3

Installed 23.10.2020 from [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17732/) (Models and Textures) 


> By mathy79 for Skyrim Special Edition (Default)

[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/Pu5z77R.png[/img][/center]
<br />
<br />Includes highly detailed meshes and corresponding textures to replace all Skyrim's small and medium size rocks and rock piles. 
<br />
<br />All the replacer models are carefully optimized for gaming.
<br />
<br />This mod uses 3 textures , 4096 x 4096 px each and their normal maps also in 2048 x 2048 px resolution.
<br />
<br />The .esp plugin is mandatory for the regional texture sets of the rockpile ground covers to work properly.
<br />
<br />
<br />Hope you enjoy.
<br />
<br />[size=4]SPECIFICS
<br />[/size]- The meshes replaced by this mod would be rockM01 - 04 , rockpileM01 - 03 , rockS01 - 03 , rockpileS01 - 04 and their wet versions.
<br />- The rock meshes have new matching collisions.
<br />- The rock pile meshes use the original bethesda's collision boxes. You may notice some offset when walking over those.
<br />- All the meshes are sculpted (to the point of that being possible) to be of similar sizes as the vanilla ones. There wont be any clipping anywhere.
<br />
<br />
<br />[size=4]INSTALLATION [/size]
<br />- Install with a mod manager or manually.
<br />
<br />[size=4]COMPATIBILITY[/size]
<br />- Should be compatible with everything.
<br />
<br />[size=4]FAQ[/size]
<br />[b]- Will this mod come with an FPS penalty?[/b]
<br />Probably not. The meshes are carefully optimized (polycount varies between 400 and 2500 vertices) and only 3 textures are used for the whole pack. On top of that, one texture set by bethesda to cover the ground mesh of the medium rockpiles (rocks01.dds) will not be used at all.
<br />
<br />[b]- Why the large rocks and rockpiles are left out?[/b]
<br />Getting old.
<br />
<br />[b]- Can i have different textures/normal maps?[/b]
<br />No. These models are materialized from real rocks and their textures and normal maps are baked from their high poly. 
<br />
<br />[b]- Will this be of a match with my mountain textures?[/b]
<br />Depends. An oldrim style rocks/mountain texture set like Noble Skyrim's will not match. A better one, like Majestic Mountains, will match perfectly fine.
<br />
